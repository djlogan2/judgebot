# judgebot
Internet Chess Club - JudgeBot auto-adjudicates games, TacticalTrainer serves tactics

<p><b>ChessSupport</b><p>Provides various functionality around the chess board. Normal chess board, pieces, legal moves, that sort of thing. It also provides code to support opening book files.
<p><b>ChessUCI</b><p>One purpose: It connects Java to a UCI engine. You use classes to interact with a loaded UCI engine in order to do whatever you want with it.
<p><b>ICCLibrary</b><p>Completely "POJO's" Internet Chess Club telnet based system. It's not even close to 100% complete, as I have added support for packets that I need, but the basic framework exists.
<p><b>JudgeBot</b><p>Just as it says. It's the code for the judgebot account
<p><b>TacticalTrainer</b><p>Also just as it says. It's the code for the TacticalTrainer and TacticCollector accounts.
